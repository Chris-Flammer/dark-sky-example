# Dark Sky API Usage Example

This is a simple app that demonstrates usage of the Dark Sky Forecast API.  On running, the app fetches the user's current location, and uses the location to retrieve a weather forecast for the next 7 days for the area.  Results are shown in a scrolling list (UITableView), with today at the top.
